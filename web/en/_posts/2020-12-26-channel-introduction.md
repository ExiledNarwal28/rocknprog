Alright, this is the big day. My first video has been uploaded! It's in French, as all my videos will be. Though, I will write articles both in French and in English on the concepts I cover.

Here, I mostly talk about my channel and the programming project I propose. So, briefly : 

 - My name is Fabien Roy. I am finishing a computer engineering degree and I got a degree in informatics. During my studies, I worked 5 years in software development. I love all programming-related things, clean code and software architecture.
 - My channel will feature some pretty laid-back videos on which I will talk about subjects related to software development. What I talk about will be oriented by the project, the comments I get and what I personally want to talk about.
 - The project will be an API written in Java (Maven) that will use technologies like GitHub, RAML, Postman and Heroku. It's a project that should resemble what we have to do at school or at work. It is, of course, fictive : it's an application that handles a space elevator. My next video will go further into detailing the use-cases for this app.

Last thing : my videos will not go into programming basics. For this, I can recommend the following websites that covers about all there is to know.
