# Fabien Roy

Yo!

I am a web developer who is a little too passionate and who wants to share his discoveries with people.

I have a diploma in computer technologies and am finishing a baccalaureate in software engineering. Moreover, I worked at [Optik 360](https://optik360.com/), [DashThis](https://dashthis.com/) and [Lib√©o](https://libeo.com/).

Like many others in the industry, I had a ton of applications to product, both at school and work. I have acquired a good amount of software development techniques that I'm enhancing with time.

On this site, I will mostly cover Java APIs. Eventually, I want to present more things, but we gotta start somewhere.
